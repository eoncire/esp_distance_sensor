# esp_distance_sensor

Testing a disstance sensor wired into a NodeMCU that is flashed with Esphome and sending data back to HA.  The sensor reports in meters but I added the config to convert it on the NodeMCU and report in Inches to HA.  Eventually this will be used to monitor the salt level of my water softener system.
